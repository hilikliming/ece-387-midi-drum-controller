#summary This page gives an overview of the project.

= Introduction =

This MIDI controller design features 4 velocity sensitive pads as well as 4 one-shot sample buttons and a button for changing the note values of the velocity sensitive pads (i.e. there are 2 note banks). This design is based on the Arduino Mega 2560 Microcontroller. The goal of this project was to create a new tool for real time music creation.

= Design =

This controller's design was relatively simple in order to allow MIDI messages to be sent without considerable delay. This was done because, for real-time music creation, lag becomes quite noticeable. This design relies on four force sensitive resistors for velocity sensitive note triggering as well as 5 'arcade' style pushbuttons for note bank toggling (1st buttons) and one-shot sampling (4 remaining buttons).

Figures 1 and 2 display two basic circuits utilized for the voltage sensing over Force Sensitive Resistors and the Push Button Logic High/Low circuits respectively. These types of circuits were used for all 4 FSR pads (pins A0-A3) and for the 5 pushbuttons (Interrupt pins 0-4, on the Mega these are pins 2,3,21,20 and 19).
