#summary This page gives an overview of the project.

= Introduction =

This MIDI controller design features 4 velocity sensitive pads as well as 4 one-shot sample buttons and a button for changing the note values of the velocity sensitive pads (i.e. there are 2 note banks). This design is based on the Arduino Mega 2560 Microcontroller. The goal of this project was to create a new tool for real time music creation.

= Design =

This controller's design was relatively simple in order to allow MIDI messages to be sent without considerable delay. This was done because, for real-time music creation, lag becomes quite noticeable. This design relies on four force sensitive resistors for velocity sensitive note triggering as well as 5 'arcade' style pushbuttons for note bank toggling (1st buttons) and one-shot sampling (4 remaining buttons).

Figures 1 and 2 display two basic circuits utilized for the voltage sensing over Force Sensitive Resistors and the Push Button Logic High/Low circuits respectively. These types of circuits were used for all 4 FSR pads (pins A0-A3) and for the 5 pushbuttons (Interrupt pins 0-4, on the Mega these are pins 2,3,21,20 and 19).

= Construction =

Construction of this apparatus took place in two stages. The initial construction of this device had no containing apparatus (i.e. Wooden Box in final version) and utilized a single velocity sensitive pad and a single button in order to experiment with the MIDI Protocol. A depression of the push button would correspond to a note high signal on some MIDI Note (0-127 values) at a medium velocity. The note value mentioned was determined by what the ADC on pin A0 read, that is, pressure on the FSR determined pitch of the note for this implementation.

Final construction implemented the concepts tested from the initial construction but in a slightly different manner. This version essentially implements multiples of the same circuits outlined in the design section. The was enclosed in a wooden box the was constructed 1" X 4" pine sides and two, top and bottom, masonite panels .

= Results =

I believe that this project was largely successful. WIth this system I was able to achieve all of the functionality that I desired in one way or another. If I were to change any two things in the way that I approached this design, I would probably choose a microcontroller with a faster processing speed, and I would have obtained high quality buttons (perhaps buttons that were already denounced). The only reason I say that is because on occasion there would be slips in
